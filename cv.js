        <p>
        I am an outgoing and active Industrial and Interactive Media Design student,  
        capable to work in collaborative environments, who is interested to belong to 
        a product design studio with a transparent and well constituted team. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Since I realized that technology has become a part of our daily products and 
        living, I began to study <span class="high-light">Interactive Media Design in 2016</span> 
        while studying <span class="high-light">Industrial Design since 2012.</span> 
        Nevertheless I have never thought about Interactive media design 
        as a tool to reinforce Industrial design but both careers as a big whole. Therefore 
        I consider myself as an <span class="high-light">Interactive Product Designer.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        This interesting  journey has allowed me to  work in “user research” projects at 
        the university, where I got to know new design methodologies (HCI, UX), I have learned 
        to program (Java, Javascript, Arduino) and to prototype my ideas (Computer based and 
        hand based) as well.
