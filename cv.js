        I am an outgoing and active Industrial and Interactive Media Design student interested to work in a product design studio with a transparent and well constituted team. But first let me tell short story:
        </p> <br>
        <p id="tale">
        Several years ago, during a field trip to a company, I had a conversation with my former design dean at Icesi University, where he told me that in order to follow my passion for design I have to be aware about how design is changing due to the trends and technological advances and look out for foreign Design Studios, where they believe in a truthful way that design can improve people way of living. 
        -To him, thank you.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Since I have realized that technology has become a part of our daily products and living, I began to study Interactive Media Design in 2016 while studying Industrial Design since 2012. Nevertheless I have never thought about Interactive media design as a tool to reinforce Industrial design but to complement it. 
        <span class="high-light"> Therefore I consider myself as an Interactive Product Designer.</span>
        </p><br>
        <p>
        This journey has taken me into the path of Human computer interaction, User experience, human centered design, Information architecture, social-technology interaction, universal design, and User interface likewise. Where I got to know new design methodologies,moreover learned to program and be able to prototype my ideas, no matter the limitations though. Moreover I consider myself capable to work in collaborative environments, and having understanding of the industrial design process as well. Besides I feel comfortable working on both Mac and PC computer and making (form and function) prototypes by hand.
